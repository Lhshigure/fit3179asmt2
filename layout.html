                        What is Covid 19?
                </h2>    
                <p>A new coronavirus designated Covid 19 was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province
                    People developed pneumonia without a clear cause and for which existing vaccines or treatments were not effective.
                    The virus has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission
                    Transmission rate (rate of infection) appeared to escalate <font style="font-weight:bold;">in mid-January 2020
                    As of 30 January 2020</font>

                </h2>
                <p>As we have seen, the number of <font style="font-weight:bold;">deaths of covid19 patients increased explosively</font> from 
                    March to April, decreased slowly from May to July, and began to increase gradually from June to July.

                    About the lethality of Coivd 19?
                </h2>
                <p>
                As we can see, although Coivd 19 does not have a <font style="font-weight:bold;">high lethality rate</font>
                it still causes a large number of deaths globally due to its highly contagious nature, 
                with the number of infected people increasing rapidly over a six-month period.
                </p>

    <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div id = text_div>
            <p>
            In the bar chart below, the number of new infections per day for covid19 starts to increase sharply from week09 to week13, levels off from week13 to week19, and then, after that, starts to increase sharply again from week21 to week29.
            But the number of new deaths per day <font style="font-weight:bold;">did not change dramatically</font>from week13 to week29.

                What about Covid 19 vaccination worldwide?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Based on the scatterplot below, we can see that Asia and Europe have <font style="font-weight:bold;">significantly higher vaccination rates</font> than other states, 
                while Africa has the lowest vaccination rates.
                <br/> 
                We also find that the Americas have <font style="font-weight:bold;">the highest</font>vaccination rates,
                but also <font style="font-weight:bold;">the highest</font>number of deaths, relative to its other states.    
                <br/>
